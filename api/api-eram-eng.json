That’s why veneers are a great option for people who are unhappy with the appearance of their teeth and want to avoid multiple treatments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A dental veneer acts as a ‘cap’ or cover for the front teeth. Each veneer is individually manufactured by our expert laboratory team.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dental veneers are made of porcelain and can be used to restore the appearance of teeth that have been damaged, are heavily stained or discoloured and to restore wide gaps in the teeth. They can be used on a single tooth or multiple teeth depending on your dental needs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The procedure.</strong></p>\n<p>You can leave Eram Dental Health Clinic with a new set of veneers in just two visits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen this cosmetic procedure, we will prepare your front teeth by removing a thin layer of dental enamel to create the ideal bonding surface for the veneer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will take impressions of your teeth and help you to choose the exact shade of veneer for your new teeth. We will send the impressions and information to our laboratory who will start the building process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the next visit, your dentist will first show you how the veneers look. Once you are happy with their appearance, the veneers will be bonded into place. These are long-lasting and durable cosmetic enhancements and we will show you how to care for them.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to offer our patients a range of finance options.

            "description": "<p>We are convinced that the smile is the quality of life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A beautiful smile and healthy, straight teeth make up for a living. But not everyone has beautiful straight teeth by nature. Often there is not enough space in the mouth for the teeth that are still in the jaw or have already grown out. This not only results in the appearance of the teeth, but can also result in health problems as reduced chewing function or tooth decay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eram Dental Health Clinic is specialized in following orthodontic treatments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Invisalign</strong></p>\n<p>Invisalign is an almost invisible solution to correct teeth for a more beautiful smile.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Invisalign aligners are practically completely transparent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More information about Invisalign at Eram Dental Health Clinic is available here. (Link to Invisalign treatment page).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Damon System</strong></p>\n<p>The Damon system is not just revolutionary braces and wires, it is a completely new orthodontic treatment method that Eram Dental Helth Clinic offers its patients. Using low biological-sensitive forces, the Damon System provides a natural 10-tooth smile and improves the patient&#8217;s overall facial aesthetics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Incognito Lingual System</strong></p>\n<p>Eram Dental Health Clinic offers an innovative Incognito Lingual concept, which fixes the braces to the inside of the teeth and is completely invisible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The passive self-ligating Damon brackets eliminate the need for elastic rubber ligatures. This facilitates tooth movement at very low forces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ceramic and Metal Braces</strong></p>\n<p>In children and adolescents, fixed braces are often chosen when the permanent teeth are in the breakthrough and space is needed for them. In general, fixed braces are used for all corrections of tooth misalignments as soon as the permanent teeth have broken through. Adults can also correct malocclusions with fixed braces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please click here or call +41/44 222 21 11 to book your appointment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please click here or call +41/44 222 21 11 to book your appointment.
