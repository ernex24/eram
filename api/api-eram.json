That\u2019s why veneers are a great option for people who are unhappy with the appearance of their teeth and want to avoid multiple treatments.</p>\n<p>A dental veneer acts as a \u2018cap\u2019 or cover for the front teeth. Each veneer is individually manufactured by our expert laboratory team.</p>\n<p>Dental veneers are made of porcelain and can be used to restore the appearance of teeth that have been damaged, are heavily stained or discoloured and to restore wide gaps in the teeth. They can be used on a single tooth or multiple teeth depending on your dental needs.</p>\n<h3>The procedure</h3>\n<p>You can leave Eram Dental Health Clinic with a new, beautiful smile in just two visits.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen this cosmetic procedure, we will prepare your front teeth by removing a thin layer of dental enamel to create the ideal bonding surface for the veneer.</p>\n<p>We will take impressions of your teeth and help you to choose the exact shade of veneer for your new teeth. We will send the impressions and information to our laboratory who will start the building process.</p>\n<p>At the next visit, your dentist will first show you how the veneers look. Once you are happy with their appearance, the veneers will be bonded into place. These are long-lasting and durable cosmetic enhancements and we will show you how to care for them.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to offer our patients a range of finance options.

If the cavity is left untreated it can grow in size and leave the inside of a tooth vulnerable to infection. A tooth that has been affected by decay may also feel more sensitive than usual.</p>\n<p>At Eram Dental Health Clinic, we offer patients white fillings made from composite resin or porcelain. White fillings are barely visible once applied to the tooth, so many of our patients prefer this option to traditional metal fillings.</p>\n<h3>The procedure</h3>\n<p>If you require a filling, we will discuss the best option for you and at the next appointment we will start the treatment.</p>\n<p>The affected tooth will be cleaned and the damaged enamel removed.
