A dental seal, in healthy teeth is here of a preventive fissure seal the speech, is done in a few minutes. However, if a major tooth defect is discovered, the hole in the tooth must first be treated with filling therapy. Subsequently, a so-called therapeutic fissure seal can be done.</p>\n<p>Although a seal is carefully processed by us, parts of the seal may be lost over time due to wear. At each inspection visit, we check the condition of the seal and, if necessary, renew or supplement the existing seal.</p>\n",

Most often, these phenomena are observed with the breakthrough of the first teeth. Affected children and adolescents complain of jaw pain, muscle tension or malaise. In addition to these painful symptoms, the teeth grinding sooner or later leads to the loss of valuable tooth substance.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>If you know that your child suffers from teeth grinding, we advise you to consult your pediatric dentist. As your pediatric dentist in Munich, we examine your child&#8217;s teeth on already crunched tooth substance and look for tension in the muscles. A transparent plastic splint, which we customize for your child, can be worn at night and prevent further healthy tooth substance from being rubbed off.</p>\n<p>In addition, we investigate the cause of the nocturnal crunch &#8211; often there is a malposition of the teeth behind it. Stress and external pressure can also cause teeth grinding.</p>\n",

With over 8&#8217;000 documented, orthodontic treatment cases, we impress with an enormous experience in childrens orthodontic treatments.</p>\n<p>At Eram Dental Health Clinic, your orthodontic clinic in Zurich, we offer following treatments for your Kids.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><strong>Removable braces</strong></span></p>\n<p>Removable braces, also called plates, are mainly used in children, in which there are still some deciduous teeth available and not all permanent teeth are broken. They are manufactured individually in the dental laboratory and consist of a plastic base with specially bent elements made of stainless steel wire. Depending on the design, these clips on the braces support the teeth and can perform minor tooth movements. By integrating an orthodontic screw, for example, the jaw can be stretched. The color selection of the plastic base can be made individually by the patient and the patient.</p>\n<p>Functional orthodontic appliances such as Bionator, Activator or Twin Block affect jaw growth with the aim of normal bite, while also normalizing muscular dysbalances in the mouth.</p>\n<p>To achieve a successful treatment, the wearing times must be adhered to. These amount to between 14 and 22 hours daily. Since the treatment options are limited with a loose braces, follows in many cases a treatment with a fixed braces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><strong>Fixed braces</strong></span></p>\n<p>The fixed braces, colloquially called &#8222;Plättlispange&#8220; or &#8222;Gartenhag&#8220;, is most commonly used in orthodontic corrections. It is usually used when all permanent teeth have broken through. With sufficient jawbone teeth can be straightened at any age.</p>\n<p>The fixed braces consist of metal or ceramic plates, the so-called brackets, which are glued to the teeth. They are used to attach a metal wire. This arch is adjusted or exchanged during treatment until the teeth are set to the desired position.</p>\n<p>We use so-called self-ligating brackets, which do not require any additional rubber or metal fastenings (ligatures) for binding the wires. In combination with a highly elastic wire, lower forces are required to move the teeth. By eliminating the additional fasteners, the brackets are also better to clean.</p>\n<p>A big advantage of the fixed braces is that the forces can act permanent and well-dosed on the teeth and so even complicated corrective movements of the teeth are possible. The treatment takes 1 to 2 years according to experience.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><strong>&#8222;Invisible&#8220; braces</strong></span></p>\n<p>Today, there are various ways to correct the malocclusion almost invisibly. We will gladly advise you which treatment is best for you.<br />\nceramic brackets</p>\n<p>The tooth-colored ceramic brackets are glued to the outside of the teeth. They are more aesthetic than metal brackets because they are barely noticeable due to their transparency. For this reason, they are popular with both teenagers and adults.<br />\nLingualtechnik</p>\n<p>In the lingual technique, the fixed braces on the inside of the teeth attached so that it is completely invisible from the outside. Since the inside of the tooth is not so prone to demineralizations / decalcifications, this brace is particularly gentle on the teeth. This procedure can usually only be used when all permanent teeth have broken through.</p>\n<p>The lingual technique is associated with increased effort for the orthodontist, because in addition to the cramped space in the oral cavity even the difficult accessibility on the inside of the tooth is added.</p>\n<p>Invisible Braces &#8211; Lingual Technique</p>\n<p>A widely used treatment system is Incognito ™, which makes individual brackets and bows individually for each patient. Further information can be found at www.incognito.net.<br />\naligners</p>\n<p>Aligners are removable and almost invisible plastic rails. They can be used to treat malocclusions without the use of metal brackets and wires. Aligners can also be used in adolescents, as long as all permanent teeth have broken through. This is usually the case from the age of 12.</p>\n<p>These aesthetic splints are suitable for simple to moderate dental malocclusions. Complex deformities are better treated with a fixed brace.</p>\n<p>One manufacturer of these plastic rails is Invisalign®. A series of aligners are custom made for you so that your teeth gently and &#8222;step by step&#8220; approach their desired position. Each splint is usually used for a period of two weeks and then replaced by the next one. It is important that the transparent splints are worn for at least 22 hours a day in order to achieve an optimal treatment result. They are taken out only for eating and brushing. Further information can be found at www.invisalign.com.</p>\n<p>In addition to the visual aesthetics, the clean oral hygiene through the removable rails, no distracting speech and the removability on special occasions benefits of Alignern. Treatment times and costs are comparable to those of conventional fixed appliances</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><strong>Retainer</strong></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the teeth do not remain in their new, straight position after orthodontic treatment. By the tooth movement during the treatment, tissue is stretched and train applied to fibers of the periodontium apparatus. Therefore, a stabilization phase is always necessary at the end of an active orthodontic treatment.</p>\n<p>In order to permanently secure the result, to prevent a relapse and to counteract further undesired tooth movements, so-called retainers are used. Retainers are available as removable devices (plates or rails) or in the form of fixed wires that are glued to the inside of the anterior teeth.</p>\n<p>The long-term stabilization with an adhesive container provides the most reliable protection against relapses and age-typical changes of the anterior tooth position. During the wearing period, however, the adhesive bond on the bow or the wire itself can break loose or break. In order not to jeopardize the success of treatment, an immediate repair or renewal should be done in addition to a careful handling.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb: The stabilization phase must last at least as long as the active treatment. However, it often takes longer and in many cases lifelong retention is recommended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><strong><span title=\"\">Combined orthodontic-oral surgery</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span title=\"\">With pronounced jaw malpositions, a treatment with braces alone does not always lead to the desired result.</span> <span class=\"\" title=\"\">In such cases, we are looking for the most promising solution for you in cooperation with oral surgeons</span></p>\n",

At Eram Dental Health Clinic we will always take extra care to examine your gums and treat signs of gum disease.</h3>\n<p>The gums support your teeth, holding them in place and acting as a barrier to bacteria. A healthy gum is pink and firm. However, over time plaque can build-up on the gum line, making the gums vulnerable to infection and disease. Smoking, a sugary diet, overlapping teeth, diseases such as diabetes and certain medications can also cause gum disease.</p>\n<p>The first stage of gum disease is gingivitis. Symptoms include bleeding of the gums, inflammation and soreness. You may even experience an infection of the gums. If you develop periodontitis you may experience more serious symptoms including abscesses, and pocketing – which is where the seal of the gum is affected and develops a deep space, where bacteria, plaque and calculus can settle and cause further damage.</p>\n<p>Periodontitis affects the jaw bone and can result in the teeth loosening or even being lost.</p>\n<p>It is very important to treat the early signs of gum disease. For example, if you experience bleeding after brushing or flossing you may want to use a specially formulated mouthwash to try and treat this, as well as brushing and flossing more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>If this issue has not resolved after a few weeks, it is important to visit Broseley Dental Practice so we can examine your gums.

At Eram Dental Health Clinic we will always take extra care to examine your gums and treat signs of gum disease.</h3>\n<p>The gums support your teeth, holding them in place and acting as a barrier to bacteria. A healthy gum is pink and firm. However, over time plaque can build-up on the gum line, making the gums vulnerable to infection and disease. Smoking, a sugary diet, overlapping teeth, diseases such as diabetes and certain medications can also cause gum disease.</p>\n<p>The first stage of gum disease is gingivitis. Symptoms include bleeding of the gums, inflammation and soreness. You may even experience an infection of the gums. If you develop periodontitis you may experience more serious symptoms including abscesses, and pocketing – which is where the seal of the gum is affected and develops a deep space, where bacteria, plaque and calculus can settle and cause further damage.</p>\n<p>Periodontitis affects the jaw bone and can result in the teeth loosening or even being lost.</p>\n<p>It is very important to treat the early signs of gum disease. For example, if you experience bleeding after brushing or flossing you may want to use a specially formulated mouthwash to try and treat this, as well as brushing and flossing more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>If this issue has not resolved after a few weeks, it is important to visit Broseley Dental Practice so we can examine your gums.

			  "description": "<p>We are convinced that a person&#8217;s smile improves the overall quality of life.</p>\n<p>A beautiful smile and healthy, straight teeth make up a large part of our identity and are an important prerequisite for success and well-being at work and in our private lives. But not everyone has beautiful straight teeth by nature. Often there is not enough space in the mouth for the teeth that are still in the jaw or have already grown out. As a result, the teeth can shift, individual teeth grow out crooked incompletely or not at all. This not only impairs the appearance of the teeth, but can also result in health problems such as reduced chewing function or tooth decay.</p>\n<p><strong>Invisalign</strong></p>\n<p>Invisalign is an almost invisible solution to correct teeth for a more beautiful smile.</p>\n<p>The Invisalign aligners are practically completely transparent. Probably no one will even notice that you are wearing these almost invisible &#8222;braces&#8220;. Invisalign can fit seamlessly into your lifestyle without interfering with your daily interaction with others.</p>\n<p>Invisalign aligners are removable. Unlike fixed metal braces, you can eat and drink anything during the treatment: just remove the aligners. In addition, you can remove the aligners to brush your teeth and floss your teeth to maintain good oral hygiene.</p>\n<p>Invisalign aligners are comfortable to wear. Unlike conventional fixed braces, there are no metal wires or braces that could cause irritation in the mouth. This also means that in most cases you will spend less time making adjustments in your clinician&#8217;s practice.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, with Invisalign you have the opportunity to view the desired results and treatment plan before the start of treatment. This way, you know from the outset what your straightened teeth will look like after completion of the treatment.</p>\n<p>More information about Invisalign at Eram Dental Health Clinic is available here. (Link to Invisalign treatment page).</p>\n<p><strong>Damon System</strong></p>\n<p>The Damon system is not just revolutionary braces and wires, it is a completely new orthodontic treatment method that Eram Dental Helth Clinic offers its patients. Traditional treatment often requires healthy teeth to be extracted and/or palate expanders to make room. These methods are often uncomfortable, take longer, may create a shorter arch and a flatter profile. Using low biological-sensitive forces, the Damon System provides a natural 10-tooth smile and improves the patient&#8217;s overall facial aesthetics.</p>\n<p><strong>Incognito Lingual System</strong></p>\n<p>Eram Dental Health Clinic offers an innovative Incognito Lingual concept, which fixes the braces to the inside of the teeth and is completely invisible. Such a solution, also known as lingual braces, also makes it possible to make the treatment progress visible for our patients and from the beginning, because the tooth correction is no longer covered by disturbing metal parts. Since this brace is worn behind the teeth, it is the correction tool of choice for all those who are not comfortable with the aesthetics of a traditional visible or transparent model. Because even if the braces are transparent, they are still worn on the outside of the teeth and are therefore visible to the person you are talking to. Such braces &#8211; invisible because they are concealed on the inside of the tooth from the outset &#8211; do not even come into view and are the aesthetic solution here. The amazingly flat design of the brackets attached to the tooth also contributes to the comfortable treatment experience. These are individually adapted to the inside of the tooth and lie flat enough not to interfere with speech &#8211; a discreet solution that is also possible for all those who work in the public eye. The brackets themselves are made of a metal alloy with a high gold content, which is particularly gentle to the organism and particularly suitable for allergy sufferers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The passive self-ligating Damon brackets eliminate the need for elastic rubber ligatures. This facilitates tooth movement at very low forces.</p>\n<p>Lightweight, high-tech shape memory wires align the teeth faster and require less adjustment.</p>\n<p>The new clinically proven approach corrects your teeth and improves the optical appearance &#8211; usually without expander or palatal expansion.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceramic and metal braces</strong></p>\n<p>In children and adolescents, fixed braces are often chosen when the permanent teeth are in the breakthrough and space is needed for them. In general, fixed braces are used for all corrections of tooth misalignments as soon as the permanent teeth have broken through. Adults can also correct malocclusions with fixed braces.</p>\n<p>Fixed braces consist of brackets, bands and arches. This is why they are also referred to as multi-band or multi-bracket appliances.</p>\n<p>Brackets are small holding bars or holding plates that are attached to the tooth surfaces with special adhesives. The thin metal bands are usually attached to the back teeth. Wire arches are then fitted into the bands and brackets. The tension of the wire arches is transferred to the brackets, which exert the desired continuous tension or pressure on each individual tooth. Since the information about the desired effect is contained in the structure of the respective bracket itself, such brackets are also called &#8222;programmed brackets&#8220;. Depending on the treatment phase, different materials and diameters are used for the wire arches.</p>\n<p>The majority of young people nowadays wear fixed braces with metal brackets, which unfortunately cannot be overlooked. In order to enhance the aesthetic value of metal brackets, coloured rubber rings can be used instead of wires to attach the wire arches to the brackets. These so-called Alastics are now available in many colours.</p>\n<p>A more aesthetically pleasing variant is transparent ceramic brackets, which are much less conspicuous.</p>\n",
